Airbnb not only has changed the possibilites of travel and ways of living, but also 
brought new business potetials. We are interested in exploring the data generated from
Airbnb, analyzing the data to find interesting facts about airbnb listing in New York.
We hope we could generate some useful insights to provide guidances for
customers and business suggestions for hosts. 

In this project, we implemented all the analysis in R (Final_Project.Rmd) with focus on data visualization. A Shiny app of interactive map is accessible through https://ysyang.shinyapps.io/AirbnbMap/ (also in folder Map).
